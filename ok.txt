Code 
Perfect! I've created all the separate HTML and JavaScript files:

📁 File Structure:
HTML Files:

index.html - Welcome screen with typewriter effect
home.html - Home page with clock and welcome message
games.html - Games page with grid layout
settings.html - Settings page with cloaking and about:blank toggle
404.html - 404 error page
CSS File:

styles.css - All styling in one file
JavaScript Files:

welcome.js - Typewriter effect, Enter button, and About:blank button
home.js - Clock and time-based greeting
games-page.js - Game grid, modal, and game functions
settings.js - Settings toggle and cloaking functions
🎨 Features:

Two buttons after typing: "ENTER" and "OPEN IN ABOUT:BLANK"
About:blank button opens site in about:blank with Google Classroom disguise
Sidebar with 4 nav items (Home, Games, Settings, 2x Coming Soon)
Discord button at bottom of sidebar
All game icons are 🎮 remotes
Home page shows current time and personalized greeting
